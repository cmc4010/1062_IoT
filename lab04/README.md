# DUMMY DEVICE
## Objective

Get a dummy output device up and running.
"Dummy" because it's just software running in the terminal and not a real device.

## SETUP

1. Install python
2. Install pip
3. Get "requests" python module

I used

`python3 -m pip install requests`

because

`python -m pip install requests`

did not have a matching distribution ( not compatible ? ).

## RUN

`python3 DAI.py`
